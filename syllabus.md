The following syllabus is designed for a typical undergraduate course where the goal is to introduce students to the concepts of operating systems. We expect the typical undergraduate introductory operating systems course to partially cover the first 13 chapters. Below are some recommendations what safely may be skipped yet still provide the student with a solid understanding of what operating systems are and what they do.
This text integrates three different APIs - Win32 (Windows), POSIX (Unix-based), and Java. You may choose to cover just one of the APIs depending upon student experience. (For example, if your curriculum is primarily C-based on Unix/Linux/Mac OS X machines, you may choose to just cover POSIX.) 

*Chapter 1: Introduction 
This chapter can be covered fairly quickly. Section 1.2 (Computer System Organization) can be skipped if students are familiar with computer organization. Section 1.10 (Distributed Systems) can be ommitted if you do not intend on covering networking. 

*Chapter 2: Operating System Structures 
Sections 2.6 (Operating System Design and Implementation), 2.8 (Virtual Machines), 2.9 (System Generation), and 2.10 (System Boot) may be omitted if desired. 

*Chapter 3: Processes 
Section 3.6 (Communication in Client-Server Systems) may be skipped if desired. 

*Chapter 4: Threads 
Section 4.4 (Threading Issues) can be covered lightly. 

*Chapter 5: Process Synchronization 
Section 5.3 (Peterson's Solution) may be omitted if you do not intend on covering software solutions to the critical section problem. Sections 5.7 (Monitors) and 5.10 (Atomic Transactions) may be omitted. 

*Chapter 6: CPU Scheduling 
Sections 6.4 (Multiple-Processor Scheduling) and 6.9 (Algorithm Evaluation) can be omitted if desired. 

*Chapter 7: Deadlocks 
You may only want to cover Sections 7.1 through 7.4. 

*Chapter 8: Main Memory 
Sections 8.6 and 8.7 may be omitted if you do not wish to cover segmented architectures. 

*Chapter 9: Virtual Memory 
Sections 9.7 (Memory-Mapped Files) and 9.8 (Allocating Kernel Memory) may be omitted if desired. Section 9.9 (Other Considerations) may be covered lightly as well. 

*Chapter 10: Mass-Storage Structure 
Sections 10.3 (Disk Attachment) may be skipped. Sections 10.5 (Disk Management) and 10.6 (Swap Space Management) may be covered lightly. Sections 10.7 (RAID Structure), 10.8 (Stable Storage Implementation) and 10.9 (Tertiary-Storage Structure) may be skipped. Disk scheduling algorithms (Section 10.4) make nice  programming exercises. 

*Chapter 11: File-System Interface 
Sections 11.3.3 and 11.3.4 may be omitted (Single-Level and Two-Level Directories). Sections 11.5 (File Sharing) and 11.6 (Protection) may be omitted if desired. 

*Chapter 12: File-System Implementation 
Section 12.2.3 (Virtual File Systems) may be skipped. Section 12.6 (Efficiency and Performance) may be covered lightly. Sections 12.7 (Recovery), 12.8 (Log-Structured File Systems) and 12.9 (NFS) may be omitted. You may also choose to skip coverage of the WAFL File System in Section 12.12. 

*Chapter 13: I/O Systems 
Section 13.1 and 13.2 may be omitted if students have an understanding of I/O hardware. Section 13.6 (STREAMS) may be omitted. Remaining sections may be covered lightly if time is running short.
